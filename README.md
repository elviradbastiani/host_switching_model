Increasing empirical evidence has revealed that host-switchings are common in the history of parasites. In this work: "D’Bastiani, E., Princepe, D., Campião, K. M., Marquitti, F. M., Boeger, W. A., & Araujo, S. L. (2022). Effect of host-switching on the eco-evolutionary patterns of parasites. bioRxiv." we propose a model to investigate how the intensity of host-switching, assumed to depend on the phylogenetic distance between hosts, affects the 
ecological and evolutionary patterns of parasite species.
